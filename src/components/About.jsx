               Welcome to my site! I am a very strong believer in working creatively and efficiently.<br />My work ethic revolves around a professional and stoic philosophy while maintaining communication and respect at the core. Combining my artistic, athletic and international background, I strongly value team, leadership, creativity and responsibility.  I love the idea of creating and being a part of something unmeasurably greater than myself. I believe in finding problems to solve and not waiting for something to go wrong. And you can trust that I will be a team player and be there for my team members and colleagues. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and experiences in a unique and creative manner for the company.
